Installing and using APCUPSD on OpenBSD 5.2

1.) Install binary package(s).
2.) Configure Apcupsd.
3.) Start daemon at boot time.

 I purchased a "Uninterruptible Power Supply" to protect my modem, router, and server from power source failure (protects connected loads from surges, spikes, lightning, and other power disturbances). I found a great deal on the "APC Back-UPS ES 550MC". Setting it up on OpenBSD 5.2 is drop dead simple. All you need is Apcupsd (a daemon for controlling APC UPSes).



1.) Install Apcupsd:


  # pkg_add apcupsd



2.)  Configure /etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.conf:

 Now it's time to edit the config file. Use your editor of choice and load up /etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.conf. My editor of choice is nano.


 # nano /etc/apcupsd/apcupsd.conf


 Scroll down to the "UPSCABLE <cable>" section and define the type of cable connecting the UPS to your computer. I use "usb" for my model. Most new Uniterruptible Power Supplies are USB.


UPSCABLE usb

 Comment from acupsd.conf: "To get apcupsd to work, in addition to defining the cable above, you must also define a UPSTYPE, which corresponds to the type of UPS you have (see the Description for more details). You must also specify a DEVICE, sometimes referred to as a port. For USB UPSes, please leave the DEVICE directive blank. For other UPS types, you must specify an appropriate port or address."
 Scroll down to UPSTYPE and change it to the appropriate port or address. The choices are usb, net, snmp, netsnmp, dumb, and pcnet. Once again mine is usb.


UPSTYPE usb
DEVICE



3.) Start Acpupsd:


  # apcupsctl start



4.) Edit /etc/rc.local so that the apcupsd service will start when the system starts up. In the rc.local file add the following:


if [ -x /usr/local/sbin/apcupsd ]; then
        echo 'Starting apcupsd'; /usr/local/sbin/apcupsd
fi




5.) Documentation, Commands, and Monitoring:

 To monitor the events of your UPS you should enter (in a separate terminal) the command ( tail -f /var/log/apcupsd.events ) and you may watch what is going on:


 # tail -f /var/log/apcupsd.events

2013-02-16 17:18:15 -0600  apcupsd 3.14.10 (13 September 2011) openbsd startup succeeded


Ctrl-C to exit tail.


You can also check /var/log/apcupsd.events:


  # cat /var/log/apcupsd.events


2013-02-16 17:18:15 -0600  apcupsd 3.14.10 (13 September 2011) openbsd startup succeeded

 Type "apc" and hit Tab key twice and you will see the Apcupsd commands. Four commands should be listed (apcaccess, apctest, apcupsctl, and apcupsd):


 # apc
apcaccess  apctest  apcupsctl apcupsd

 "apcaccess" is a program that permits you to print out the complete status of your UPS. Take a look at the apcaccess output of my APC Back-UPS ES 550MC:

 "apctest" is a program that allows you to talk directly to your UPS and run certain low-level tests, display all know values from the UPS's EEPROM, perform a battery runtime calibration, program the EEPROM (serial connection only), and enter in TTY mode with the UPS. You have to stop Apcupsd before running apctest ( apcupsctl stop ):


 # apcupsctl stop
Stopping apcupsd power management  Done.
