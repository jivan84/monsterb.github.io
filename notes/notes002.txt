Get your external IP address from the command line.

This one is from BSDGurl. Dependencies: curl,wget

$ wget -q -O - checkip.dyndns.org|sed -e 's/.*Current IP Address: //' -e 's/<.*$//'



These two are from Aaron B. The first one (ftp -V -o - http://ip.qbit.io) works with base OpenBSD and FreeBSD with zero external dependencies! The second one needs 'curl'.

$ ftp -V -o - http://ip.qbit.io

and

$ curl ifconfig.me
