          language that makes functional programming easy to perform, and easy to mix with other programming styles. In this paper, David Mertz, a director of Python Software Foundation, examines the 
          functional aspects of the language and points out which options work well and which ones you should generally decline.</p>

          <p><a href="http://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/">Learn Python the Hard Way</a> (Python 2) This simple book by Zed Shaw is meant to get you started in programming. The title says it's the hard way to learn to 
          write code but it's actually not. It's only the "hard" way because it uses a technique called instruction. Instruction is where I tell you to do a sequence of controlled exercises designed 
          to build a skill through repetition. This technique works very well with beginners who know nothing and need to acquire basic skills before they can understand more complex topics. It's used 
          in everything from martial arts to music to even basic math and reading skills.</p>

          when there aren’t a lot of resources to step beyond the ‘learn syntax’ to programming. Often there are questions of, “Well, I worked through this beginner book. Now what?” How do you answer 
          that?<br />
          &nbsp;Many want to learn to code, and many choose Python as a first language. You direct them to Learn Python the Hard Way, Codecademy, or Dive into Python. Great! But now what?<br />
